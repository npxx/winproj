### Image Generation

This folder contains the header files `color.h`, `vec3.h` and a sample program `img.cpp` for producing a `.ppm` file.

Note: Run the program as `.\a > img.ppm` to save the output as a `.ppm` file.

You can view the generated image at [this page](https://www.cs.rhodes.edu/welshc/COMP141_F16/ppmReader.html)
